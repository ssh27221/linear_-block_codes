# linear_-block_codes
To set-up MONTE CARLO SIMULATION to determine the performance of (7,3) Linear Block Code over an AWGN channel.

Linear Block codes are effective way of reducing bit error rate/Improving the SNR (Signal to
noise ratio) over a noisy channel (white Noise). Linear block codes are defined in terms of
generator and parity-check matrices. Syndrome vector are used for error detection. <br>

**DESIGN APPROACH: (TOOL: MATLAB)** : <br>
To calculate the reduction in the SNR using Linear block codes-
